<h1>Apache Subversion Project Ideas</h1>

<p>This page collects project ideas for volunteers looking for tasks
which are of a significant size. If you wish to make a significant
contribution to Subversion but aren't yet sure what you would like
to work on, this page is for you.</p>

<p>These project ideas are considered suitable for programs such as
<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/"
>Google Summer of Code</a>
and the <a href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen"
>Outreach Program for Women</a>.</p>

<ul>

<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Improve bindings to other programming languages.</p>
    <p>One of Subversion's strengths is that it offers a rich set of
    &quot;binding surfaces&quot;: APIs that are available not only in C
    (Subversion's native language) but in other programming languages as
    well (currently Perl, Python, Ruby, and Java).</p>
    <p>Some of these language bindings are maintained via <a
     href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>, a tool that partially automates
    the process of generating bindings, while others are maintained by
    hand.  Many of the bindings do not have complete coverage yet, or have
    interface problems where they do have coverage (for instance, they might
    not expose all API elements of the latest Subversion release).
    So even though the bindings are used in many production systems,
    and used to build popular Subversion clients such as <a
    href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a>, there's still
    plenty of work to do.</p>
    <p>Another huge problem for users of the bindings is a
    <a href="http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2011-02/0544.shtml"
    >lack of proper documentation</a> specific to the bindings.</p>

    <p>Required technical skills:
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced programming experience in the C programming language
          and at least two of Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, and C++.</li>
      <li>Expertise in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language"
          >programming language theory</a> is strongly recommended.
          You should know what a data type system is and how compilers
          and interpreters work.</li>
      <li>A solid understanding of <a href="http://swig.org/">SWIG</a>
          and/or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_native_interface"
          >JNI</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</li>

<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Show progress output.</p>
    <p>Improve the progress output displayed during update and commit.
    See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-901"
    >issue&nbsp;#901</a> for details.</p>
    <p>Required technical skills:
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced programming experience in the C programming language.</li>
      <li>Some experience with the Python programming language.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</li>

<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Improve 'svn help'.</p>
  <p>Currently, the texts shown by the <tt>svn help</tt> command are being
     maintained directly in the main source code file of the <tt>svn</tt>
     binary, which can be viewed online <a
     href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/subversion/svn/svn.c"
    >here</a>.
    It has been <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201209.mbox/%3C1347648306.66873.YahooMailNeo%40web87705.mail.ir2.yahoo.com%3E"
    >proposed</a> to move these help texts into a separate file format instead.</p>
    <p>This could ease maintenance of help text translations, allow shipping
    of UNIX-style manual pages for each <tt>svn</tt> subcommand, and might also
    make it possible to consolidate the help texts and the
    <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.ref.html"
    >reference section</a> of the
    <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">Subversion Book</a>.</p>
    <p>It has also been <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201209.mbox/%3C20120914200410.GC8439@ted.stsp.name%3E"
    >suggested</a> to add a tutorial mode to <tt>svn help</tt> to make
    it easier for new users to get started with Subversion without consulting
    the documentation upfront.</p>
    <p>Required technical skills:
    <ul>
      <li>Some experience with the C and Python programming languages.</li>
      <li>Knowledge of open source documentation systems such as
          <a href="http://docbook.org/">docbook</a> and
          <a href="http://mdocml.bsd.lv/">mdoc</a>.</li>
      <li>The ability to clearly explain technical concepts in written
          English.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">More customizable behavior for 'svn diff'.</p>
    <p>Add support for fully customizable external diff invocations, and
    support for external diff commands for non-text types. See <a
    href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-2044"
    >Issue&nbsp;#2044</a> and <a
    href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-2447"
    >issue&nbsp;#2447</a> for details.</p>
    <p>Required technical skills:
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced programming experience in the C programming language.</li>
      <li>Some experience with the Python programming language.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</li>

<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">XML output for 'svn mergeinfo'</p>
    <p>Teach <tt>svn mergeinfo</tt> to create XML output.
    See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-4245"
    >issue&nbsp;#4245</a> for details.</p>
    <p>Required technical skills:
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced programming experience in the C programming language.</li>
      <li>Some experience with the Python programming language.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</li>

<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Implement 'svnadmin unpack'</p>
    <p>Once a FSFS repository has been packed, it's shard size can
    no longer be changed.  Also, it cannot benefit from packing
    improvements in later releases.</p>
    <p>Add an <tt>unpack</tt> sub-command to svnadmin that reverts a
    packed FSFS repository back to non-packed state.  The repository
    will be off-line during the unpack process (as opposed to packing
    live repositories).  Later improvements may include <tt>repack</tt>
    and <tt>reshard</tt>.</p>
    <p>Required technical skills:
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced programming experience in the C programming language.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</li>

<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Enable interoperability testing.</p>
    <p>The tests frameworks (<tt>make check</tt>) have limited support for
    testing with different client and server versions (1.8-dev clients and
    1.7 server, for example; or vice-versa).  Make it easier to run such
    interoperability/compatibility tests.  Ideally, also lay the groundwork
    to setting up a <a href="/buildbot/all">buildslave</a>
    to run these tests regularly (we'll provide the hardware).</p>
    <p>A related goal is compatibility with older on-disk formats, but at the
    time of writing the author believes the <tt>--server-minor-version</tt>
    option and <tt>upgrade_tests.py</tt> cover what is needed.</p>
    <p>Required technical skills:
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced programming experience in the Python programming language.</li>
      <li>Some experience with system administration of UNIX-like operating
          systems.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</li>

<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">None of the above? Find a project idea in
    the issue tracker!</p>
    <p>Our <a href="reporting-issues.html">issue tracker</a> contains plenty
    of open tasks and unfixed bugs. The list of <a
    href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20%22SVN%22%20and%20labels%20%3D%20%22bite-sized%22%20and%20status%20in%20%28Open%2C%20Reopened%29"
    >issues that might be relatively easy to fix</a> is a good starting
    point.</p>
