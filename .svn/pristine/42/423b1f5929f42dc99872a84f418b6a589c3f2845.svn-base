<h1>Apache Subversion Issues</h1>

<div class="bigpoint">

<p>Please do not file new issues before validating your complaint via
   a well-formed bug report sent to:</p>

<p><a href="mailto:users@subversion.apache.org"
                  >users@subversion.apache.org</a></p>

<p>Unvalidated issues will be unceremoniously closed.  Trust us
   &mdash; we have <a href="docs/community-guide/issues.html" >good
   reasons</a> for this.</p>

</div> <!-- .bigpoint -->

<p>Chances are good that if you're on this page, you've come either to
   complain about Subversion, or you've come to check on a previous
   complaint about Subversion.  Hey, we understand that.  And for what
   it's worth, Subversion is the amazing software that it is largely
   because of the constructive criticism we've received about it over
   the years.  Having said that, we <strong>strongly</strong>
   recommend that if you've not done so already, you read the
   <a href="docs/community-guide/issues.html" >"Bugs / Issues" section</a>
   of the <a href="docs/community-guide/" >Subversion Community
   Guide</a>.  Not only will you learn how to increase the quality of
   your own complaints and requests, but in doing so, you'll increase
   the likelihood that we'll recognize them as constructive.</p>


<div class="h2" id="queries">
<h2>Handy Dandy Issue Tracker Queries
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#queries"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>Do you know the Subversion issue number you're interested in?  Use
   this form to view that issue directly.</p>

<form method="get" onsubmit="this.action='https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-'+this.issueNumber.value;">
<div style="display: inline;">
<input name="issueNumber" size="10" placeholder="Issue number..."
       style="width: 10em" 
       type="number"
       />
<input type="submit" value="Jump to issue" />
</div>
</form>

<p>Perhaps you'd rather do a natural language search through issue
   descriptions?</p>

<form onsubmit="window.open('https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=' + escape('project = SVN AND text ~ &quot;'+this.searchText.value+'&quot;'));">
<div style="display: inline;">
<input name="searchText" size="20" placeholder="Keywords..."
       style="width: 10em" 
       />
<input type="submit" value="Keyword search" />
</div>
</form>

<p>Here are some issue tracker query links that we believe are of
   general utility to folks.  If you don't see one here that you like,
   that's okay, you can formulate your own structured query at 
   <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SVN"
           >https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project = SVN</a>.</p>

<p>Subversion's previous issue tracker can be accessed at <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues</a>. Its content was transferred to the new tracker in September 2015. Since then, it is available for read-only access, until we decide to turn it off.</p>
