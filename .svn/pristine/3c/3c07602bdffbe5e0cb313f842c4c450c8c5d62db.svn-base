  Subversion svnserve servers up to 1.7.9 (inclusive) are vulnerable
  to a remotely triggerable DoS vulnerability.  

Summary:
========

  Subversion's svnserve server process may exit when an incoming TCP connection
  is closed early in the connection process. 

  This can lead to disruption for users of the server.

Known vulnerable:
=================

 Subversion servers through 1.7.9 (inclusive).
 Subversion servers through 1.6.21 (inclusive).

Known fixed:
============

 Subversion 1.7.10
 Subversion 1.6.23
 Subversion 1.8.0
 mod_dav_svn (any version) is not vulnerable.

Details:
========

  During a connection attempt svnserve improperly treats aborted connections
  as critical errors, prints an error message and exits.  The error message
  will look like this:
  svnserve: E000053: Can't accept client connection: Software caused connection abort 

  The problem is that svnserve is not properly checking for aborted connection
  error returns from the accept() call.

Severity:
=========

  CVSSv2 Base Score: 7.8
  CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C 

  We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability.  An exploit exists and
  has been tested to work against this vulnerability.  We do not believe the
  exploit is being actively used in the wild at this time.

  A remote attacker can cause svnserve to exit and thus deny service to users
  of the server.  The attack does not require that the attacker authenticate.
  
  Due to differences in implementations of their TCP stacks some operating
  systems may be more or less prone to this behavior.  FreeBSD and OpenBSD are
  known to be particularly vulnerable.  We believe that this is still possible
  with all operating systems though.

  svnserve when used in inetd, tunnel (svn+ssh), and Win32 service modes is
  not vulnerable as they do not use the accept() call in question.

Recommendations:
================

  We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.7.10 or 1.6.23.
  Users who are unable to upgrade may apply the included patches.
  
  New Subversion packages can be found at:
  http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html

  Using svnserve in inetd, tunnel or Win32 service modes can be used to
  mitigate this problem.  There are no known methods to mitigate this attack
  in daemon mode.
