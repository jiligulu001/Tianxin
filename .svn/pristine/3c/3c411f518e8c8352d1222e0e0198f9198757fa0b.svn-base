  mod_dav_svn is vunerable to a remotely triggerable segfault DoS vulnerability
  when SVNListParentPath is on.

Summary:
========

  Subversion's mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module will crash when it
  receives an OPTIONS request against the server root and Subversion is
  configured to handle the server root and SVNListParentPath is on.

  This can lead to a DoS.  There are no known instances of this
  problem being exploited in the wild, but the details of how to exploit
  it have been disclosed on the Subversion development mailing list.

Known vulnerable:
=================

  Subversion HTTPD servers 1.3.0 through 1.7.14 (inclusive)
  Subversion HTTPD servers 1.8.0 through 1.8.5 (inclusive)

Known fixed:
============

  Subversion 1.7.15 (not publicly released)
  Subversion 1.7.16
  Subversion 1.8.6-1.8.7 (not publicly released)
  Subversion 1.8.8
  svnserve (any version) is not vulnerable

Details:
========

  When Subversion is configured on the root path of the server and the
  SVNListParentPath directive is set to on then the following commands
  will trigger a segfault:
    svn list http://svn.example.com/
    svn lock http://svn.example.com/

  This occurs because when mod_dav_svn attempts to calculate the parent
  path of the request is ends up setting a NULL pointer (since there can be
  no parent of the server root URI), which is later assumed to be valid memory.

  When Subversion is configured on any Location other than "/" (e.g. "/svn")
  then the problem does not occur since the parent of the path can be
  calculated and stored in memory.

Severity:
=========

  CVSSv2 Base Score: 4.3 
  CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P

  We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability.  Repositories which
  allow for anonymous reads will be vulnerable without authentication.
  However, we believe the required configuration is relatively rare.  Most
  systems are not hosting Subversion on the root path of the server and
  only a small number of those have the SVNListParentPath configuration on.

  A remote attacker may be able to crash a Subversion server.  Many Apache
  servers will respawn the listener processes, but a determined attacker
  will be able to crash these processes as they appear, denying service to
  legitimate users.  Servers using threaded MPMs will close the connection
  on other clients being served by the same process that services the
  OPTIONS request from the attacker.  In either case there is an increased
  processing impact of restarting a process and the cost of per process
  caches being lost.

Recommendations:
================

  We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.8.8.  Users of
  Subversion 1.7.x or 1.8.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the
  included patch.

  New Subversion packages can be found at:
  http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html

  Administrators that wish to protect against this without patching
  immediately can apply the following configuration to their httpd.conf
  file:
  [[[
    <LocationMatch ^/$>
      <LimitExcept GET>
        Order Deny,Allow
        Deny from all
      </LimitExcept>
    </LocationMatch>
  ]]]

  CAUTION: The above configuration should only be used when Subversion is
  enabled on the root location in a parent path configuration.  For example the
  following is the minimal configuration that matches this case:
  [[
    <Location />
      DAV svn
      SVNParentPath /var/svn
    </Location>
  ]]

  In this case it will not block any useful requests and can be used without
  concern that it will break anything.  If Subversion is running on any other
  path or is not being used in a parent path configuration this configuration
  should not be applied as these configurations are not vulnerable and it can
  break functionality of Subversion or other applications being served from the
  same httpd.
