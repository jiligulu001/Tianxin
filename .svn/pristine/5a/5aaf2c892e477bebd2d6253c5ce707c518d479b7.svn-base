  Remotely triggerable heap overflow and out-of-bounds read caused by
  integer overflow in the svn:// protocol parser.

Summary:
========

  Subversion servers and clients are vulnerable to a remotely triggerable
  heap-based buffer overflow and out-of-bounds read caused by an integer
  overflow in the svn:// protocol parser.

  This allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
  execute arbitrary code under the context of the targeted process.

Known vulnerable:
=================

  Subversion 1.9.0 through 1.9.2 (inclusive)

  Only servers and clients using svn:// protocol are vulnerable
  Subversion httpd servers and clients (any version) are not vulnerable

Known fixed:
============

  Subversion 1.9.3

Details:
========

  The svnserve svn:// protocol strings are sent as a length followed by
  the string data.  The protocol parsing logic contains a flaw that allows
  an attacker to write memory past the end of a heap buffer with a specially
  crafted request that causes an arithmetic overflow.

  Since the flaw is in the parsing of the protocol, exploiting this
  vulnerability against an svnserve server does not require authentication
  from the remote attacker.

  The parsing code with the flaw is shared by both the svnserve server and
  clients using the svn://, svn+ssh:// and other tunneled svn+*:// methods.

Severity:
=========

  CVSSv2 Base Score: 9
  CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C

  We consider this to be a high risk vulnerability.  An exploit exists and
  has been tested to work against this vulnerability.

  The denial of service attack is reasonably easy to carry out, while
  exploiting the heap overflow is more difficult, depending upon how skilled
  the attacker is and upon the specifics of the platform.  We do not believe
  the exploit is being actively used in the wild at this time.

Recommendations:
================

  We recommend all users of Subversion 1.9.x to upgrade to Subversion 1.9.3.
  Users of Subversion 1.9.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the included
  patch.

  No workaround is available.
