<p>The Subversion project is pleased
   <a href="http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2010-02/0418.shtml">to announce</a>
   that we have graduated from the Incubator at the Apache Software Foundation
   and are now officially <em>Apache Subversion</em>.  Although this is
   largely a procedural step, it's an important one for our goal of making the
   ASF the permanent home of the Subversion community.</p>

<p>We'd like to thank the ASF for this vote of confidence, and look forward
   to the opportunities that wait us as Apache Subversion.</p>

  <a class="sectionlink" href="#news-20091107"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>The Subversion project has been accepted into
   the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">Apache Incubator</a>, the
   first step on the road to becoming a full-fledged, top-level Apache
   project.  You can read more about this exciting development in the
   related <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/press/pr_2009_11_04.html">press
   release</a>.</p>

<p>Part of this transition involves migrating our project assets
   (websites, bugs, mailing lists, etc.) over to the Apache hosting
   infrastructure.  We'll be doing this gradually over time in order
   to ensure a smooth transition with minimum loss of momentum.  So if
   you can't find what you're looking for here at this website,
   chances are good that we've not yet migrated that information yet
   from our <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" >old
   website</a>.</p>
