  Remotely triggerable heap overflow and out-of-bounds read in mod_dav_svn
  caused by integer overflow when parsing skel-encoded request bodies.

Summary:
========

  Subversion's httpd servers are vulnerable to a remotely triggerable
  heap-based buffer overflow and out-of-bounds read caused by an integer
  overflow when parsing skel-encoded request bodies.

  This allows remote attackers with write access to a repository to cause
  a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code under the context
  of the httpd process.  32-bit server versions are vulnerable to both the
  denial-of-service attack and possible arbitrary code execution.  64-bit
  server versions are only vulnerable to the denial-of-service attack.

Known vulnerable:
=================

  Subversion httpd servers 1.7.0 to 1.8.14 (inclusive)
  Subversion httpd servers 1.9.0 through 1.9.2 (inclusive)

  Subversion svnserve servers (any version) are not vulnerable

Known fixed:
============

  Subversion 1.8.15
  Subversion 1.9.3

Details:
========

  The Subversion http://-based protocol used for communicating with
  a Subversion mod_dav_svn server has two versions, v1 and v2.  The v2
  protocol was added in Subversion 1.7.0.  As a part of the commit happening
  over v2 protocol, the client sends a POST request with the request body
  containing data encoded in a special `skeleton' (or `skel') format.

  The parser of skel-encoded request bodies in mod_dav_svn contains a flaw
  that allows the attacker to write memory past the end of a heap buffer
  with a specially crafted request that causes an arithmetic overflow in
  32-bit server versions.  64-bit server versions are not vulnerable to
  the heap-based buffer overflow, but can be forced into allocating huge
  amounts of memory, thus, the successful attack on them would cause
  denial-of-service conditions.

  Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to be authenticated
  and to have write access to a repository on the targeted server.

Severity:
=========

  CVSSv2 Base Score: 4.6
  CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

  We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability.  In order to take
  advantage of this attack the attacker would require write access to the
  repository.  Most configurations require authentication to commit changes
  and so anonymous users would not be able to use this attack in these cases.

  With the write access, the denial of service attack is reasonably easy
  to carry out, while exploiting the heap overflow is more difficult,
  depending upon how skilled the attacker is and upon the specifics of
  the platform.

  In case of the denial of service attack, a remote attacker may be able
  to crash a Subversion server.  Many Apache servers will respawn the
  listener processes, but a determined attacker will be able to crash
  these processes as they appear, denying service to legitimate users.
  Servers using threaded MPMs will close the connection on other clients
  being served by the same process that services the request from the
  attacker.  In either case there is an increased processing impact of
  restarting a process and the cost of per process caches being lost.

Recommendations:
================

  We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.9.3.  Users of
  Subversion 1.8.x and 1.9.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the
  included patch.

  No workaround is available.
