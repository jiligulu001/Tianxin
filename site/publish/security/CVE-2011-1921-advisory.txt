  Subversion HTTP servers 1.5.0 to 1.6.16 (inclusive) could leak the
  contents of files configured to be unreadable.

Summary:
========

  Subversion's mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module may leak to
  remote users the file contents of files configured to be unreadable
  by those users.

  There are no known instances of this problem being observed in the
  wild, but an exploit has been tested.

Known vulnerable:
=================

  Subversion HTTPD servers >= 1.5.0 and <= 1.6.16

Known fixed:
============

  Subversion 1.6.17
  svnserve (any version) is not vulnerable

Details:
========

  Subversion Apache/mod_dav_svn servers may be configured to provide
  path-based access control for files and directories stored in the
  Subversion repository.

  In the general case, mod_dav_svn asks access questions ("Does the
  user who is requesting information from this server have permission
  to read SOME-PATH in SOME-REVISION?") of Apache's authorization
  subsystem using Apache's internal subrequest mechanism.  Apache
  partially handles these subrequests, returning either a successful
  or an unsuccessful status code after its authorization subsystem has
  determined whether read access to the requested resource URL has
  been granted or denied, respectively.

  In certain circumstances, mod_dav_svn improperly generates the
  resource URLs that it uses in these subrequests, resulting in
  Apache's authorization subsystem answering the access question for
  the incorrect resource.  Specifically, this leakage is limited to:
  
    * files and directories which are themselves configured to be
      unreadable, but 

    * which are children (immediate or otherwise) of a readable
      directory which itself was copied or moved from an unreadable
      path, and

    * which were present in that directory at the time of its copy or
      move.

    * Finally, the attacker must be using mod_dav_svn's "replay"
      REPORT mechanism to access the extended history of the
      repository.

  NOTE: This vulnerability is not triggerable if mod_dav_svn is
  configured with the "SVNPathAuthz short_circuit" httpd.conf
  directive.  Unfortunately, an independent denial of service
  vulnerability (CVE-2011-1783) prevents the use of this approach
  as a suitable workaround.

Severity:
=========

  File contents of privileged documents could be leaked in full to
  users who shouldn't be permitted to see them.

  NOTE:  We believe this leak is limited to a specific revision of
  those documents -- the revision in which their parent directory was
  copied from an unreadable location -- but have not verified as much.

Recommendations:
================

  We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.6.17.  Users of
  Subversion 1.5.x or 1.6.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the
  included patch.
