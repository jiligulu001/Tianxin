  Subversion HTTP servers up to 1.6.16 (inclusive) are vulnerable to a
  remotely triggerable NULL-pointer dereference.

Summary:
========

  Subversion's mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module will dereference
  a NULL pointer if asked to deliver baselined WebDAV resources.

  This can lead to a DoS.  An exploit has been tested, and tools or users
  have been observed triggering this problem in the wild.

Known vulnerable:
=================

  Subversion HTTPD servers <= 1.6.16

Known fixed:
============

  Subversion 1.6.17
  svnserve (any version) is not vulnerable

Details:
========

  Subversion's mod_dav_svn module implements a subset of the WebDAV
  and DeltaV protocols to support version control operations with
  Subversion clients and, to a limited extent, certain other
  WebDAV-aware client programs.  The protocol dictates the existance
  and use of so-colled "baselined resources" which do not directly
  represent versioned files or directories, but instead represent
  somewhat more abstract concepts.  (See the specifications of those
  protocols for details.)  As a result, these baselined resources --
  which are addressable using specifically formatted URLs -- are not
  suitable for generic delivery in response to the common GET HTTP
  request.

  Because of this vulnerability, mod_dav_svn fails to notice that a
  request submitted against the URL of a baselined resource should
  simply return a graceful error and instead attempts to process the
  request.  This ultimately leads to a dereference of the pointer
  associated with the resource's repository path, which is NULL
  because the resource cannot be said to have such a path.

Severity:
=========

  A remote attacker may be able to crash a Subversion server.  Many Apache
  servers will respawn the listener processes, but a determined attacker
  will be able to crash these processes as they appear, denying service to
  legitimate users.

Recommendations:
================

  We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.6.17.  Users of
  Subversion 1.5.x or 1.6.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the
  included patch.
