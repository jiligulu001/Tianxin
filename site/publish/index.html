<p>Welcome to <strong>subversion.apache.org</strong>, the online home
   of the Apache Subversion&trade; software project.  Subversion is an open
   source version control system.  Founded in 2000 by CollabNet, Inc., the
   Subversion project and software have seen incredible success over
   the past decade.  Subversion has enjoyed and continues to enjoy
   widespread adoption in both the open source arena and the corporate
   world.</p>

<p>Subversion is developed as a project of the
   <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>, and as
   such is part of a rich community of developers and users.  We're always
   in need of individuals with a wide range of skills, and we invite you
   to participate in the development of Apache Subversion.  Here's
   <a href="/contributing.html">how to get started</a>.</p>

    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted
   as an open-source, centralized version control system characterized
   by its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the
   simplicity of its model and usage; and its ability to support the
   needs of a wide variety of users and projects, from individuals to
   large-scale enterprise operations.</p>

<h2>About This Site
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#site-overview"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>This website is the central source of information about Subversion
   and the community which gives it life.  Here, you'll find resources
   that are useful to existing and potential Subversion users and
   developers alike.  Want to read about Subversion's features?  Need
   to download the latest Subversion release?  Perhaps you've thought
   of a great enhancement and you're wondering how to share the idea
   with the developers?  This site will help you do all that.</p>

<p>Who is this site <em>not</em> aimed at?  Well, there are many
   third-party tools which exist as part of the greater Subversion
   ecosystem, but aren't part of the core project itself.  Subversion
   clients such as TortoiseSVN, or Subversion's integrations into
   various IDE's such as Eclipse and NetBeans, or the pure Java
   implementation of Subversion called SVNKit &mdash; these are all
   valuable pieces of the Subversion story, but each is managed as its
   own project outside of the core Subversion offering.  This site
   really isn't so much about those projects.</p>

<p>The sections below provide a high-level overview of how this
   website is organized, making reference to
   the <a href="#site-nav-menu">navigation menu</a> you should find on
   the left-hand side of each page of the website.</p>

<p>The "About Subversion" section of the website is Information
   Central.  You can read the latest Subversion
   <a href="/news.html">News</a>, learn about Subversion's rich set
   of <a href="/features.html">Features</a>, and consult various
   sources of <a href="/docs/">Documentation</a> about Subversion and
   the processes that govern that interactions of the Subversion
   community.  There's a <a href="/faq.html">Frequently Asked

<h3>The "Getting Subversion" Section

<p>Learning about Subversion is great, but the real fun is in applying
   that knowledge.  The "Getting Subversion" section of the website is
   all about making sure Subversion finds it way into your hands.
   This community releases source code archives of the various
   Subversion versions, which you can get via
   the <a href="/source-code.html">Source Code</a> menu.  (That's also
   a good place to look for instructions on checking out Subversion's
   source code from the repository in which it lives.)  But if you'd
   rather not deal with building Subversion yourself, there are a
   number of places where you can get precompiled
   <a href="/packages.html">Binary Packages</a> of Subversion, built
   for various platforms.</p>
