<h1>Apache Subversion Documentation</h1>

<p>Apache Subversion is fortunate to have a community that values
   documentation.  This page contains pointers to varies sources of
   documentation aimed at Subversion users and developers both of
   Subversion and of third-party tools with which Subversion
   integrates.  Much of this documentation is itself freely licensed,
   so if you spot errors in them, please feel free to submit
   corrections to the relevant owners of the documentation.</p>

</h2>

<p>If you want to know how to use Subversion, you can find a number of
   published user manuals available
   for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aamazon.com+Subversion+version+control"
   >purchase</a> online.  One of these texts
   &mdash; <span style="font-style: italic;" >Version Control With
   Subversion</span> (affectionately known as "the Subversion book")
   &mdash; carries a free license, was developed openly by the
   Subversion community itself, and is also available in full online
   for free at <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/"
   >http://svnbook.red-bean.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Community Guides

<p>The Subversion community operates at peak efficiency when everyone
   honors the various policies which were established by the community
   as the result of years of experience.  The following documents
   provide invaluable insight into How Stuff Gets Done Around Here.
   We hope you find them useful not only as you contribute to
   Subversion, but also as you then seek to develop and establish best
   practices in your own software projects.</p>

<h2>Subversion API
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#api"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>Subversion is a collection of modular libraries written in the C
   programming language, each of which has a clearly defined
   collection of functions and types that together make up
   Subversion's application programming interface (API).  This API is
   stable within major release streams of the software itself, so if
   you write software that uses Subversion 1.1.0's interfaces, you
   should expect that software to continue to work when the Subversion
   libraries are upgraded to 1.6.0 without your having to change or
   recompile your software at all.</p>
