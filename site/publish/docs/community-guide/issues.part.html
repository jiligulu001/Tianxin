<p>Subversion isn't perfect software.  It contains bugs, lacks
features, and has room for improvement like any other piece of
software.  Like most software projects, the Subversion project makes
use of an issue tracking tool to manage known outstanding issues with
the software.  But perhaps <em>unlike</em> most software projects, we
try to keep our issue tracker relatively free of debris.  It's not
that we don't want to hear about Subversion's problems&nbsp;&mdash; after
all, we can't fix what we don't know is broken.  It's just that we've
found a mismanaged issue tracker to be more of a hindrance than a
help.</p>

<p>This mail pretty much says it all (except that nowadays you should
post to the users@ list before posting to the dev@ list):</p>

<pre>
   From: Karl Fogel &lt;kfogel@collab.net&gt;
   Subject: Please ask on the list before filing a new issue.
   To: dev@subversion.tigris.org
   Date: Tue, 30 Jul 2002 10:51:24 (CDT)
   
   Folks, we're getting tons of new issues, which is a Good Thing in
   general, but some of them don't really belong in the issue tracker.
   They're things that would be better solved by a quick conversation
   here on the dev list.  Compilation problems, behavior questions,
   feature ideas that have been discussed before, that sort of thing.
   
   *Please* be more conservative about filing issues.  The issues
   database is physically much more cumbersome than email.  It wastes
   people's time to have conversations in the issues database that should
   be had in email.  (This is not a libel against the issue tracker, it's
   just a result of the fact that the issues database is for permanent
   storage and flow annotation, not for real-time conversation.)
   
   If you encounter a situation where Subversion is clearly behaving
   wrongly, or behaving opposite to what the documentation says, then
   it's okay to file the issue right away (after searching to make sure
   it isn't already filed, of course!).  But if you're
   
      a) Requesting a new feature, or
      b) Having build problems, or
      c) Not sure what the behavior should be, or
      d) Disagreeing with current intended behavior, or
      e) Not TOTALLY sure that others would agree this is a bug, or
      f) For any reason at all not sure this should be filed,
   
   ...then please post to the dev list first.  You'll get a faster
   response, and others won't be forced to use the issues database to
   have the initial real-time conversations.
   
   Nothing is lost this way.  If we eventually conclude that it should be
   in the issue tracker, then we can still file it later, after the
   description and reproduction recipe have been honed on the dev list.
   
   Thank you,
   -Karl
</pre>

<p>The following are the policies that we ask folks to abide by when
reporting problems or requested enhancements to Subversion.</p>

<div class="h2" id="reporting-bugs">
<h2>How to report a bug
  <a class="sectionlink" href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_ISSUES_PAGE" -->#reporting-bugs"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>First, make sure it's a bug.  If Subversion does not behave the way
you expect, look in the documentation and mailing list archives for
evidence that it should behave the way you expect.  Of course, if it's
a common-sense thing, like Subversion just destroyed your data and
caused smoke to pour out of your monitor, then you can trust your
judgement.  But if you're not sure, go ahead and ask on the users
mailing list first, <a href="mailto:users@subversion.apache.org"
>users@subversion.apache.org</a>, or ask in IRC, <a
href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#svn">irc.freenode.net, channel #svn</a>.</p>

<p>You should
also <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html#queries"
>search in the bug tracker</a> to see if anyone has already reported
this bug.</p>

<p>Once you've established that it's a bug, and that we don't know
about it already, the most important thing you can do is come up with
a simple description and reproduction recipe.  For example, if the
bug, as you initially found it, involves five files over ten commits,
try to make it happen with just one file and one commit.  The simpler
the reproduction recipe, the more likely a developer is to
successfully reproduce the bug and fix it.</p>

<p>When you write up the reproduction recipe, don't just write a prose
description of what you did to make the bug happen.  Instead, give a
literal transcript of the exact series of commands you ran, and their
output.  Use cut-and-paste to do this.  If there are files involved,
be sure to include the names of the files, and even their content if
you think it might be relevant.  The very best thing is to package
your reproduction recipe as a script; that helps us a lot.  Here's an
example of such a script: <a href="repro-template.sh">repro-template.sh
</a> for Unix-like systems and the Bourne shell, or <a
href="repro-template.bat">repro-template.bat</a> for Windows shell
(contributed by Paolo Compieta); we'd welcome the contribution
of a similar template script for other systems.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">Quick sanity check: you *are* running
the most recent version of Subversion, right? :-) Possibly the bug has
already been fixed; you should test your reproduction recipe against
the most recent Subversion development tree.</p>

<p>In addition to the reproduction recipe, we'll also need a complete
description of the environment in which you reproduced the bug.  That
means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your operating system</li>
<li>The release and/or revision of Subversion</li>
<li>The compiler and configuration options you built Subversion with</li>
<li>Any private modifications you made to your Subversion</li>
<li>The version of Berkeley DB you're running Subversion with, if any</li>
<li>Anything else that could possibly be relevant.  Err on the side
    of too much information, rather than too little.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have all this, you're ready to write the report.  Start
out with a clear description of what the bug is.  That is, say how you
expected Subversion to behave, and contrast that with how it actually
behaved.  While the bug may seem obvious to you, it may not be so
obvious to someone else, so it's best to avoid a guessing game.
Follow that with the environment description, and the reproduction
recipe.  If you also want to include speculation as to the cause, and
even a patch to fix the bug, that's great&nbsp;&mdash; see the <a
href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_GENERAL_PAGE" -->#patches">patch submission guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>Post all of this information to <a
href="mailto:dev@subversion.apache.org"
>dev@subversion.apache.org</a>, or if you have already been there and
been asked to file an issue, then go to the <a
href="http://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html">issue
tracker</a> and follow the instructions there.</p>

<p>Thanks.  We know it's a lot of work to file an effective bug
report, but a good report can save hours of a developer's time, and
make the bug much more likely to get fixed.</p>

<div class="h2" id="milestones">
<h2>Milestone management
  <a class="sectionlink" href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_ISSUES_PAGE" -->#milestones"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>Issue tracker milestones are an important aspect of how the
Subversion developers organize their efforts and communicate with each
other and with the Subversion user base.  With the exception of some
milestones used primarily when doing high-level
<a href="#issue-triage">issue triage</a>, the project's issue tracker
milestones tend to be named to reflect release version numbers and
variations thereof.  Milestones are used for slightly different
purposes depending on the state of the issue, so it's important to
understand those distinctions.</p>

<div class="h3" id="milestones-open">
<h3>Milestones for open issues
  <a class="sectionlink" href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_ISSUES_PAGE" -->#milestones-open"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>For open issues (those whose status is <tt>OPEN</tt>,
<tt>IN PROGRESS</tt>, or <tt>REOPENED</tt>), the milestone
indicates the Subversion release for which the developers are
targeting the resolution of that issue.  In the general case, we use
milestones of the form <tt><em>MINORVERSION</em>-consider</tt> to
indicate that the resolution of an issue is being considered as
something we'd like to release in <em>MINORVERSION</em>.0.  For
example, a feature we think we can and should add to Subversion 1.9.0
will get a <tt>1.9-consider</tt> milestone.  For obvious reasons, the
accuracy of these release targets gets increasingly worse the farther
into the future you look and, as such, users are encouraged
to <em>not</em> treat them as binding promises from the developer
community.</p>

<p>At any given time, there is work toward "the next big release"
happening in the community.  As that release begins to take shape, the
developers will get a better feel for which issues are "must-haves"
for the release (also known as "release blockers"), which ones are
"nice-to-haves", and which ones should be deferred to a future release
altogether.  Issue milestones are the mechanism used to carry the
results of those decisions.  An issue that is deemed to be a release
blocker will be moved from the <tt><em>MINORVERSION</em>-consider</tt>
milestone to the <tt><em>MINORVERSION</em>.0</tt> milestone;
"nice-to-haves" will be left with
the <tt><em>MINORVERSION</em>-consider</tt> milestone; and issues
deferred from the release will be re-milestoned either
with <tt><em>ANOTHERMINORVERSION</em>-consider</tt>
or <tt>unscheduled</tt>, depending on whether we have a clear guess as
to when the issue will be addressed.</p>

<p>Continuing the previous example, as development on Subversion
1.9.0-to-be progresses, developers will be evaluating that feature we
planned for the release.  If we believe that Subversion 1.9 should not
be released without that feature, we'll change its milestone
from <tt>1.9-consider</tt> to <tt>1.9.0</tt>; if we hope to release
with that feature but don't want to commit to it, we'll leave the
milestone as <tt>1.9-consider</tt>; and if we know good and well we
aren't going to get around to implementing the feature in the 1.9.x
release series, we'll re-milestone the issue to something else
(<tt>1.10-consider</tt>, perhaps).</p>

<p>The accuracy of the <tt><em>MINORVERSION</em>.0</tt> milestone is
very important, as developers tend to use those issues to focus their
efforts in the final days of a major release cycle.</p>

</div> <!-- milestones-open -->

<div class="h3" id="milestones-fixed">
<h3>Milestones for fixed issues
  <a class="sectionlink" href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_ISSUES_PAGE" -->#milestones-fixed"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>For fixed issues (those whose status is <tt>RESOLVED</tt> and the
resolution is <tt>FIXED</tt>), the issue milestone takes on a new
utility: tracking the Subvesion release version which first carries
the resolution of that issue.  Regardless of the targeted release
version for a given issue, once it is resolved its milestone should
reflect the exact version number of the release which will first carry
that resolution.</p>

</div> <!-- milestones-fixed -->

<div class="h3" id="milestones-closed">
<h3>Milestones for other closed issues
  <a class="sectionlink" href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_ISSUES_PAGE" -->#milestones-closed"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>For other closed issues (those which aren't "open" and weren't
really "fixed"), the issue milestone tends to mean pretty much
nothing.  There's little point in trying to maintain that tracker
field when the issue itself is being effectively ignored because it's
a duplicate, or because it's an invalid or inaccurate report.</p>

</div> <!-- milestones-closed -->

<div class="h3" id="milestones-transitioning">
<h3>Transitioning between states
  <a class="sectionlink" href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_ISSUES_PAGE" -->#milestones-transitioning"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>Care must be taken when transitioning an issue between these
states.  An open issue that's been resolved needs to have its
milestone adjusted to reflect the Subversion release which will first
reflect that change.  A resolved issue that gets backported to a
previous release stream needs to have its milestone adjusted to point
to that previous release's version number.  Finally, a resolved issue
that gets <tt>REOPENED</tt> needs to have its milestone reevaluated in
terms of whether the issue is a release blocker
(<tt><em>MINORVERSION</em>.0</tt>) or not
(<tt><em>MINORVERSION</em>-consider</tt>).  In such situations, it can
be helpful to consult the issue's change history to see what milestone
was used before the issue was resolved as fixed.</p>

</div> <!-- milestones -->


<div class="h2" id="issue-triage">
<h2>Issue triage
  <a class="sectionlink" href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_ISSUES_PAGE" -->#issue-triage"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>When an issue is filed, it goes into the special milestone "---",
meaning <em>unmilestoned</em>.  This is a holding area that issues
live in until someone gets a chance to look at them and decide what to
do.</p>

<p>The unmilestoned issues are listed first when you sort by
milestone, and <em>issue triage</em> is the process of trawling
through all the <a
href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SVN%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC"
>open issues</a> (starting with the unmilestoned ones), determining
which are important enough to be fixed now, which can wait until
another release, which are duplicates of existing issues, which have
been resolved already, etc.  For each issue that will remain open, it
also means making sure that the various fields are set appropriately:
type, subcomponent, platform, OS, version, keywords (if any), and so
on.</p>

<p>Here's an overview of the process (in this example, 1.5 is the next
release, so urgent issues would go there):</p>

<pre>
    for i in issues_marked_as("---"):
      if issue_is_a_dup_of_some_other_issue(i):
        close_as_dup(i)
      elif issue_is_invalid(i):
        # A frequent reason for invalidity is that the reporter
        # did not follow the <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html">"buddy system"</a> for filing.
        close_as_invalid(i)
      elif issue_already_fixed(i):

<p>This document is for information about how Subversion developers respond to
security issues.  To report an issue, please see the <a href="/security/">
Security reporting instructions</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Subversion's first job is keeping your data safe.  To do that, the
Subversion development community takes security very seriously.  One way we
demonstrate this is by not pretending to be cryptography or security experts.
Rather than writing a bunch of proprietary security mechanisms for Subversion,
we prefer instead to teach Subversion to interoperate with security libraries
and protocols provided by those with knowledge of that space.  For example,
Subversion defers wire encryption to the likes of OpenSSL.  It defers
authentication and basic authorization to those mechanisms provided by Cyrus
SASL or by the Apache HTTP Server and its rich collection of modules.  To the
degree that we can leverage the knowledge of security experts by using the
third-party libraries and APIs they provide, we will continue to do so.</p>

<p>This document describes the steps we take when receiving or finding an
issue which may be classified as having security implications, and is meant to
suppliment the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/security/committers.html">Apache guidelines</a>
to committers for the same.</p>

<!-- Some thoughts about what to put here:
