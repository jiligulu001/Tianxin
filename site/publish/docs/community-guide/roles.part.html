<p>Committers in the Subversion project are those folks to whom the
right to directly commit changes to our version controlled resources
has been granted.  The project is meritocratic, which means (among
other things) that project governance is handled by those who do the
work.  There are two types of commit access: full and partial.  Full
means anywhere in the tree, partial means only in that committer's
specific area(s) of expertise.  While every contribution is valued
regardless of its source, not every person who contributes code to
Subversion will earn commit access.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/COMMITTERS"
>COMMITTERS</a> file lists all committers, both full and partial, and
says the domains for each partial committer.</p>

<div class="h3" id="full-commit-access">
<h3>How full commit access is granted
  <a class="sectionlink" href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_ROLES_PAGE" -->#full-commit-access"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>After someone has successfully contributed a few non-trivial
patches, some full committer, usually whoever has reviewed and applied
the most patches from that contributor, proposes them for commit
access.  This proposal is sent only to the other full committers --
the ensuing discussion is private, so that everyone can feel
comfortable speaking their minds.  Assuming there are no objections,
the contributor is granted commit access.  The decision is made by
consensus; there are no formal rules governing the procedure, though
generally if someone strongly objects the access is not offered, or is
offered on a provisional basis.</p>

<p><i>The primary criterion for full commit access is good
judgment.</i></p>

<p>You do not have to be a technical wizard, or demonstrate deep
knowledge of the entire codebase, to become a full committer.  You
just need to know what you don't know.  If your patches adhere to the
guidelines in this file, adhere to all the usual unquantifiable rules
of coding (code should be readable, robust, maintainable, etc.), and
respect the Hippocratic Principle of "first, do no harm", then you
will probably get commit access pretty quickly.  The size, complexity,
and quantity of your patches do not matter as much as the degree of
care you show in avoiding bugs and minimizing unnecessary impact on
the rest of the code.  Many full committers are people who have not
made major code contributions, but rather lots of small, clean fixes,
each of which was an unambiguous improvement to the code.  (Of course,
this does not mean the project needs a bunch of very trivial patches
whose only purpose is to gain commit access; knowing what's worth a
patch post and what's not is part of showing good judgement :-) .)</p>

<p>To assist developers in discovering new committers, we record
patches and other contributions in a <a href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_CONVENTIONS_PAGE" -->#crediting">special
crediting format</a>, which is then parsed to produce a
browser-friendly <a
href="http://www.red-bean.com/svnproject/contribulyzer/">contribution
list</a>, updated nightly.  If you're thinking of proposing someone
for commit access and want to look over all their changes, that <a
href="http://www.red-bean.com/svnproject/contribulyzer/">contribution
list</a> might be the most convenient place to do it.</p>

<div class="h3" id="partial-commit-access">
<h3>How partial commit access is granted
  <a class="sectionlink" href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_ROLES_PAGE" -->#partial-commit-access"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>A full committer sponsors the partial committer.  Usually this
means the full committer has applied several patches to the same area
from the proposed partial committer, and realizes things would be
easier if the person were just committing directly.  Approval is not
required from the full committers; it is assumed that sponsors know
what they're doing and will watch the partial committer's first few
commits to make sure everything's going smoothly.</p>

<p>Patches submitted by a partial committer may be committed by that
committer even if they are outside that person's domain.  This
requires approval (often expressed as a +1 vote) from at least one
full committer.  In such a case, the approval should be noted in the
log message, like so:</p>

<pre>
   Approved by: lundblad
</pre>

<p>Any full committer may offer anyone commit access to an
experimental branch at any time.  It is not necessary that the
experimental branch have a high likelihood of being merged to trunk
(although that's always a good goal to aim for).  It's just as
important that the full committer&nbsp;&mdash; all the full
committers, actually&nbsp;&mdash; view such branches as training
grounds for new developers, by giving feedback on the commits.  The
goal of these branches is both to get new code into Subversion and to
get new developers into the project.  See also the <a

<p>When a tool is accepted into the <i>contrib/</i> area, we
automatically offer its author partial commit access to maintain the
tool there.  Any full committer can sponsor this.  Usually no
discussion or vote is necessary, though if there are objections then
the usual decision-making procedures apply (attempt to reach consensus
first, then vote among the full committers if consensus cannot be

<p>Code under contrib/ must be open source, but need not have the same

<p>Any committer, whether full or partial, may commit fixes for
obvious typos, grammar mistakes, and formatting problems wherever they

<h2>Release Manager

</h2>

<p>The role of the Release Manager in the Subversion project is to
handle the process of getting code stabilized, packaged and released
to the general public.  If we were building planes, the RM would be
the guy looking at the construction checklists, painting the airline
logo on the fuselage, and delivering the finished unit to the
customer.</p>

<p>As such, there is no real development associated with being an RM.
All the work you have to do is non-coding: coordinating people,
centralizing information, and being the public voice announcing new
stable releases.  A lot of the tasks that the RM has to do are
repetitive, and not automated either because nobody has broken down
and written the tools yet, or because the tasks require human
validation that makes automation a little superfluous.  You can read
more about the release process in the section
<a href="releasing.html">Making Subversion Releases</a>.</p>

<p>You may be thinking at this stage that the RM's duty is
unglamorous, and you are kinda right.  If you are looking for a
position within the project that will bring fame and fortune, you're
better off implementing stuff that really needs to be done on trunk.
If you're looking for something that really helps people who don't
care about releases focus on code, then RMing is for you.</p>

<p>In an effort to encourage wider dispersion of release management
knowledge, the RM role is currently rotating among various
<del>victims</del> volunteers.</p>

<h2>Patch Manager

</h2>

<p>Subversion usually has a Patch Manager, whose job is to watch the
dev@ mailing list and make sure that no patches "slip through the
cracks".</p>

<p>This means watching every thread containing "[PATCH]" mails, and
taking appropriate action based on the progress of the thread.  If the
thread resolves on its own (because the patch gets committed, or
because there is consensus that the patch doesn't need to be applied,
or whatever) then no further action need be taken.  But if the thread
fades out without any clear decision, then the patch needs to be saved
in the issue tracker.  This means that a summary of any discussion
threads around that patch, and links to relevant mailing list
archives, will be added to some issue in the tracker.  For a patch
which addresses an existing issue tracker item, the patch is saved to
that item.  Otherwise, a new issue of the correct type &mdash; 'DEFECT',
'FEATURE', or 'ENHANCEMENT' (<em>not</em> 'PATCH') &mdash; is filed, the
patch is saved to that new issue, and the "<tt>patch</tt>" keyword is recorded
on the issue.</p>

<p>The Patch Manager needs a basic technical understanding of
Subversion, and the ability to skim a thread and get a rough
understanding of whether consensus has been reached, and if so, of
what kind.  It does <em>not</em> require actual Subversion development
experience or commit access.  Expertise in using one's mail reading
software is optional, but recommended :-).</p>

<p>The current Patch Manager is:
Gavin 'Beau' Baumanis &lt;gavin@thespidernet.com&gt;.</p>
