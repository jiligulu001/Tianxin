<p>Translation has been divided into two domains.  First, there is the
translation of server messages sent to connecting clients.  This issue
has been <a
href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/l10n-problems"
>punted for now</a>.  Second there is the translation of the client and its
libraries.</p>

<h2>Localization overview

</h2>

<p>The gettext package provides services for translating messages.  It
uses the xgettext tool to extract strings from the sources for
translation.  This works by extracting the arguments of the _(), N_() and
Q_() macros.  _() is used in context where function calls are allowed
(typically anything except static initializers).  N_() is used whenever
_() isn't.  Strings marked with N_() need to be passed to gettext
translation routines whenever referenced in the code.  For an example,
look at how the header and footer are handled in subversion/svn/help-cmd.c.
Q_() is used for messages which have singular and plural version.</p>

<p>Beside _(), N_() and Q_() macros also U_() is used to mark strings which
will not be translated because it's in general not useful to translate
internal error messages. This should affect only obscure error messages
most users should never ever see (caused by bugs in Subversion or
very special repository corruptions). The reason for using U_() is to
explicitly note that a gettext call was not just forgotten.</p>

<p>When using direct calls to gettext routines (*gettext or
*dgettext), keep in mind that most of Subversion code is library code.
Therefore the default domain is not necessarily Subversion's own
domain.  In library code you should use the dgettext versions of the
gettext functions.  The domain name is defined in the PACKAGE_NAME
define.</p>

<p>All required setup for localization is controlled by the ENABLE_NLS
conditional in svn_private_config.h (for *nix) and
svn_private_config.hw (for Windows).  Be sure to put</p>

<pre>
   #include "svn_private_config.h"
</pre>

<p>as the last include in any file which requires localization.</p>

<p>Also note that return values of _(), Q_() and *gettext() calls are UTF-8
encoded; this means that they should be translated to the current
locale being written as any form of program output.</p>

<p>The GNU gettext manual
(<a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/gettext_toc.html"
>http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/gettext_toc.html</a>)
provides additional information on writing translatable programs in
its section "Preparing Program Sources".  Its hints mainly apply to
string composition.</p>

<p>Currently available translations can be found in <a
href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/subversion/po/"
>the po section of the repository</a>.  Please contact
dev@subversion.apache.org when you want to start a translation not
available yet.  Translation discussion takes place both on that list
and on dedicated native language mailing lists (<a

<p>Before starting a new translation please contact the subversion
development mailing list to make sure you are not duplicating efforts. Also
please note that the project has a strong preference for translations which
are maintained by more than one person: mailing the lists with your

<p>The Subversion project has

<p>Before submitting to the mailing list or committing to the repository,
please make sure your po file 'compiles'.  You can do this with these
steps (on Makefile based systems):</p>

<ol>
  <li>run <code>./autogen.sh</code></li>
  <li>run <code>./configure</code> (with the appropriate arguments)</li>
  <li>run <code>make locale</code></li>
</ol>

<p>The autogen.sh step is important, since it adds new po files as
dependencies of the 'locale' build target.  Note however that steps 1
and 2 are only needed once after you have added a new translation.</p>

<p>Please don't mail large po files to the mailing lists.  There are many
subscribers on dev@subversion.apache.org who are on slow links and do
not want to receive a large file by email.  Instead, place the po file
somewhere on the Internet for download, and just post the URL.  If you
do not have a site available, please ask on dev@ and someone will help
you find a location.</p>

<p>Of course, if you have commit access to the Subversion repository, you
can just commit the po file there, assuming all other requirements
have been satisfied.</p>

<h2>Updating existing po files
  <a class="sectionlink" href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_L10N_PAGE" -->#updating"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>The Makefile based part of the build system contains a make target to
facilitate maintenance of existing po files.  To update po files on
systems with GNU gettext run</p>
<pre>
    make locale-gnu-po-update
</pre>

<p>To only update a particular language, you may use</p>
<pre>
    make locale-gnu-po-update PO=ll
</pre>
<p>where ll is the name of the po file without the extension (i.e. PO=sv).</p>

<p>It is recommended that the .po update is done by using two commits; one
after the "make locale-gnu-po-update", and one after the translation is
done. This has two advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gettext(1)</code> produces lots of line number changes which makes
  the resulting diff hard to review by the other translators. By committing
  twice, all the line number changes are stored in the first commit, and
  the second commit contains all the actual translations with no extra
  garbage.</li>
<li>If there are several translators for a specific language (which is
  highly preferred by the project) you don't risk working for hours just
  to find that some other translator already has done the job when
  you're finished. You will immediately notice that someone else is
  working on the .po file when you try to perform the first commit,
  because svn will tell you that the file is outdated.</li>
</ul>

<div class="h2" id="branch-maintenance">
<h2>Maintenance on branches
  <a class="sectionlink" href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_L10N_PAGE" -->#branch-maintenance"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>Editing po files in trunk is pretty straightforward, but gets a bit more
complicated when those changes are going to be transferred to a release
branch.  Project policy is to make no direct changes on release branches,
everything that is committed to the branch should be merged from trunk.
This also applies to po files.  Using <code>svn merge</code> to do the job
can lead to conflicts and fuzzy messages due to the changes in line numbers
and string formatting done by gettext.</p>

The scheme below eliminates any complexity which exists when using <code>svn
merge</code> to do branch updates. The following rules apply:

<ul>
  <li>Translation updates go to trunk</li>
  <li>Messages required on the branch which ever existed on trunk
    get merged from trunk</li>
  <li>There are 2 mass operations allowed on po files on branches:
    <ul>
      <li><code>make locale-gnu-po-update</code></li>
      <li>merging messages from trunk (see below)</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>The remaining few messages which never existed on trunk
    in any revision are translated on the branch</li>
  <li>Message options (such as fuzzy) can be tweaked</li>
</ul>

<p>The above list is a complete enumeration of all operations allowed on
po files on branches.</p>

<p>Merging messages from trunk revision X of YY.po to your branch working
copy can be done with this command:</p>
<pre>
  svn cat -r X ^/subversion/trunk/subversion/po/YY.po | \
    po-merge.py YY.po

<div class="h2" id="po-mo-requirements">
<h2>Requirements for po and mo files
  <a class="sectionlink" href="<!--#echo var="GUIDE_L10N_PAGE" -->#po-mo-requirements"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>On some gettext implementations we have to ensure that the mo
files&nbsp;&mdash; whether obtained through the project or created
locally&nbsp;&mdash; are encoded using UTF-8.  This requirement stems
from the fact that Subversion uses UTF-8 internally, some
implementations translate to the active locale
and the fact that <code>bind_textdomain_codeset()</code> is not portable
across implementations.</p>

To satisfy this requirement po files are required to be UTF-8 encoded.
If the gettext implementation on the target system doesn't support
bind_textdomain_codeset(), the build system will ensure that the mo
file is in UTF-8 by removing the Content-Type header from the po file
header.  Note that some msgfmt utilities dislike the absence of the
charset designator and will generate warnings along the lines of
"Won't be able to do character set conversion" because of it.  You can
safely ignore these warnings.

<p>Some gettext implementations use a section with a msgid "" (empty
string) to keep administrative data.  One of the headers suggested is
the 'Last-Translator:' field.  Because the Subversion project has a
policy not to name contributors in specific files, but give credit in
the repository log messages, you are required not to put your name in
this field.</p>

<p>Since some tools require this field to consider the po file valid
(i.e. Emacs PO Mode), you can put "dev@subversion.apache.org" into
this field.</p>
