<p>Apache Subversion 1.10 is a superset of all previous Subversion
releases, and is as of the time of its release considered the current
"best" release.  Any feature or bugfix in 1.0.x through 1.9.x is also
in 1.10, but 1.10 contains features and bugfixes not present in any
earlier release.  The new features will eventually be documented in a
1.10 version of the free Subversion book
(<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com" >svnbook.red-bean.com</a>).</p>

<p>This page describes only major changes.  For a complete list of
changes, see the 1.10 section of the <a
href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/CHANGES" >CHANGES</a>
file.</p>

<h2>Compatibility Concerns
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#compatibility"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.10
servers and clients.  However, some of the new 1.10 features may not be
available unless both client and server are the latest version.  There are
also cases where a new feature will work but will run less efficiently if
the client is new and the server old.</p>

<p>There is <strong>no need</strong> to <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate.svnadmin"
>dump and reload</a> your repositories. 
Subversion 1.10 servers can read and write to repositories created by
earlier versions.  To upgrade an existing server installation, just install the
newest libraries and binaries on top of the older ones.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.10 maintains API/ABI compatibility with earlier
releases, by only adding new functions, never removing old ones.  A
program written to any previous 1.x API can both compile
and run using 1.10 libraries.  However, a program written for 1.10
cannot necessarily compile or run against older libraries.</p>

<p>There may be limited cases where the behavior of old APIs has been
slightly modified from previous releases.  These are cases where edge cases
of the functionality has been deemed buggy, and therefore improved or removed.
Please consult the
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/api-errata/1.10/"
>API errata</a> for more detailed information on what these APIs are
and what impact these changes may have.</p>

<h3>Upgrading the Working Copy
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#wc-upgrade"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.10 uses the same working copy format as Subversion 1.8 and 1.9.</p>

<p>Before using Subversion 1.10 with an existing Subversion 1.7 or older
working copy, users will be required to run the <tt>svn upgrade</tt> command
to upgrade working copy metadata to the new format. This command may take a
while in some cases, and for some users, it may be more practical to simply
checkout a new working copy.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Subversion 1.10 cannot upgrade working copies that
a 1.6 client would have refused to operate upon before an <tt>svn cleanup</tt>
was run (with a 1.6 client).  In other words, before upgrading to 1.8 or newer,
a 1.6
or older client must be used to run <tt>svn cleanup</tt> on all 1.6 or older
working copies that require cleanup.  Likewise, Subversion 1.10 cannot upgrade
corrupt working copies. Unfixable problems can arise from missing or corrupt
meta-data inside <tt>.svn</tt> directories.  Such damage to the working copy
is permanent, and cannot be fixed even if <tt>svn cleanup</tt> is run prior
to the upgrade.</p>

<p>If your working copy does not upgrade cleanly, please check out a new one.
</p>

<p>There are some additional specific areas where changes made in this

<h4>This release is numbered 1.10
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#this-release-is-1.10"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h4>

<p>Since "1.10.0" is smaller than "1.9.0" when considered as ASCII strings,
scripts that compare Subversion versions as strings may fail to correctly
determine which of "1.10.0" and "1.9.0" is the more recent one.  Such
scripts should be changed to compare Subversion version numbers correctly:
as tuples of integers, with an optional suffix for development or pre-release
versions.  See
<a href="/docs/community-guide/releasing#release-numbering"
>the Subversion release numbering documentation</a>
for details.  (Programs written against the C API or the various bindings
should refer to the 
<!-- TODO: link is broken (doxygen not yet generated) -->
<a href="https://subversion.apache.org/docs/api/1.9/svn__version_8h.html"

<h4><tt>svnadmin</tt> subcommands print locked paths differently
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#svnadmin-LOCK_PATH-canonical"

<!-- This documents https://svn.apache.org/r1797122 -->

<p>The
<tt>svnadmin lock</tt>,
<tt>svnadmin unlock</tt>, and
<tt>svnadmin rmlocks</tt>
subcommands print the locked path differently.</p>

<p>In 1.9 and earlier, the path would be printed out in exactly the form it was input.
In 1.10, the path is printed in "canonical" form:
with dot components (<tt>foo/./bar</tt>) elided and multiple slashes (<tt>foo//bar</tt>) compressed to one.
The path also starts with a slash in the output,
regardless of whether a leading slash was present in the input.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
$ svnadmin-1.9 lock r //iota jrandom logmsg opaquelocktoken:42
'//iota' locked by user 'jrandom'.
$ svnadmin-1.9 unlock r //iota jrandom opaquelocktoken:42
'//iota' unlocked by user 'jrandom'.


$ svnadmin-1.10 lock r //iota jrandom logmsg opaquelocktoken:42
'/iota' locked by user 'jrandom'.
$ svnadmin-1.10 unlock r //iota jrandom opaquelocktoken:42
'/iota' unlocked by user 'jrandom'.
$
</pre>

<p>Only the output is changed.
The set of valid inputs and the behaviour of <tt>svnadmin</tt> on them are unchanged.
<tt>svnadmin</tt> continues to accept paths either with or without multiple slashes,
dot components, and so on as command-line arguments.</p>

<div class="h3" id="authzperf">
<h3>Improved path-based authorization 
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#authzperf"
     title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>
<p> Subversion 1.10 provides a new implementation of path-based authorization
    with improved performance and wildcard support.</p>

<p>Existing authz rules come in two flavours, repository-specific and global:
   <pre>
   [repos:/path]
   [/path]</pre>
   In these rules, <tt>/path</tt> is always matched literally.</p>

<p>The new authz rule parser supports two new forms for rules which may contain
   wildcards in the path element:
   <pre>
   [:glob:repos:/path]
   [:glob:/path]</pre></p>

<p>The following wildcard syntax elements are supported in glob rules:
<ul>
<li><tt>*</tt> matches a single (exactly one), arbitrary path segment</li>
<li><tt>**</tt> matches an arbitrary number of path segments, separated by a forward slash: <tt>/</tt></li>
<li>Classic wildcard patterns such as <tt>*foo*.bar</tt> work as expected, including escaping of special
    characters with a backslash: <tt>\</tt></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>All wildcards apply to full path segments only, i.e. <tt>*</tt> never matches <tt>/</tt>, except for the
case where <tt>/**/</tt> matches zero or more path segments. For example, <tt>/*/**/*</tt> will match any path
which contains at least 2 segments and is equivalent to <tt>/**/*/*</tt> as well as <tt>/*/*/**</tt>. </p>

<p>Because a glob rule is not required to contain wildcards in the path, two sections
   with different names may apply to the same path. For example, the following two
   rules are identical:
   <pre>
   [/path/without/wildcards]
   [:glob:/path/without/wildcards]</pre>
   The new authz rule parser detects and rejects such collisions.</p>

<p>The old authz parser, in Subversion 1.9 and earlier, allowed syntactic
   entries which grant write-only access. For example:
   <pre>
   [/]
   * = w</pre>
  The new parser flags such entries as invalid.
  Neither the old nor the new authz implementation support write-only access.</p>

<div class="h3" id="conflict-resolver">
<h3>New interactive conflict resolver
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#conflict-resolver"
     title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.10 provides much better interactive resolution of tree conflicts
   than previous releases.
   Interactive conflict resolution has been completely redesigned and rewritten.
   This new conflict resolver supersedes the first implementation introduced
   in Subversion 1.5.</p>

<p>The new conflict resolver searches repository history for structural changes
   (additions, deletions, copies, and moves) which conflict with local changes
   in the working copy and cause tree conflicts. Tree conflicts are now described
   in detail, including revision numbers and names of authors of conflicting changes.
   In previous versions of Subversion, the task of finding such information was
   left to the user. Automating this task is a huge usability improvement.</p>

<p>The new conflict resolver is able to detect moves and renames in repository
   history, and take them into account while modifying the local working copy.
   This makes seamless merging between branches possible even if one or both
   branches rename files or directories. For best results, all SVN clients
   committing to the repository should be at version 1.8 or higher.</p>

<p>The new conflict resolver will avoid asking users about resolution options
   whenever there is a only one reasonable course of action. For example, if
   a file was moved to another location in the repository, the conflict
   resolver will attempt to resolve the tree conflict on behalf of the user
   by performing the same move locally if necessary. This allows users to focus
   their attention on conflicts which cannot be resolved automatically.</p>

<p>Because detection of moves and renames involves heuristics, detection
   is not perfect and won't work in all conceivable cases. For a detailed
   description of how incoming moves and renames are detected, see <a
   href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/resolve-moves">
   How Subversion's conflict resolver handles incoming moves</a>.
   </p>
 
<p>The conflict resolver user interface remains largely unchanged. Like in
   previous releases, the resolver will be started automatically if an update,
   merge, or switch operation ends with unresolved conflicts. It can also be
   started on demand by running the <tt>svn resolve</tt> command. For more
   information, run <tt>svn help resolve</tt> after installing Subversion 1.10.</p>

<p>In some situations, resolving one tree conflict will cause new other tree conflicts
   to appear. The <tt>svn resolve</tt> command will keep iterating over such conflicts
   until none are left, or until the user decides to quit the operation.</p>

<p>The new conflict resolver can be driven interactively with
   <tt>svn resolve</tt>, from Subversion's client API (in C and other language
   bindings), or with the non-interactive <a
   href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/tools/client-side/svnconflict">svnconflict</a>
   tool which is intended for use in shell scripts.</p>

<p>The new conflict resolver offers a variety of automated tree conflict resolution
   options which users can choose from. Not all kinds of tree conflicts can yet be
   described and resolved. The options available in Subversion 1.10.0 are listed in
   the table below. In this table, the items on the incoming and local side are either
   both files or both directories. Most cases where files clash with directories are
   not handled yet.</p>

<p>Future releases of Subversion will continue to provide enhancements for the new
   conflict resolver. We expect to add coverage of additional conflict cases and add
   additional resolution options even in patch releases (i.e. in 1.10.1, 1.10.2, etc.).</p>

<p>A new <tt>--no-flush-to-disk</tt> option has been added to the
