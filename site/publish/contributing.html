<h1>Getting Involved with Apache Subversion and the Community</h1>

<p>There are many ways that you can contribute to Apache Subversion and
   the community.  Fortunately most of these require little more than
   an interest in Subversion and helping other members of the community.</p>

<div class="bigpoint">
<p>The <a href="/docs/community-guide/">Subversion Community Guide
   (aka "HACKING")</a> is a quasi-religious text that encapsulates all
   the finer details of the processes and best-practices surrounding
   contributions to the Subversion community.  Anyone considering
   contributing to Subversion should strongly consider reading this
   document.</p>

<ul>
<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Participate in the mailing lists</p>
    <p>There are community <a href="mailing-lists.html">mailing
       lists</a> you can join to discuss Subversion. The lists are an
       excellent source for users and contributors interested in
       having technical discussions, answering questions, or resolving
       potential issues for newcomers.</p>
</li>

<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Promote Subversion</p>
    <p>Help promote Subversion by using your blog,
       <a href="http://twitter.com/" >Twitter</a>,
       <a href="http://facebook.com/" >Facebook</a>, or submitting an
       article to your favorite local magazine.  If you are a member
       of a different open source community, why not mention
       Subversion on their discussion forums or at conferences? If you
       love Subversion, don't hold back &mdash; speak up!  The more
       developers use Subversion, the more bugs will be caught, the
       more features will be added, the more visible the project, and
       the more benefits the community will get.</p>
</li>

<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Link to subversion.apache.org</p>
    <p>The success of any open source project depends on the number of
       people who use the product and contribute back to the project.
       By linking to <a href="http://subversion.apache.org"
       >http://subversion.apache.org</a>, you increase the chances of
       a new user or contributor finding out about the project and
       joining the community.</p>

<h2>Monitor Subversion's Quality
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#issues"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<ul>
<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">File a bug report</p>
    <p>Bug reports take little time to file and are very helpful to
       developers.  This is one of the easiest contributions you can
       make.  When you discover a problem with Subversion, please
       report it.  Our preference as a community is to have you first
       report the bug to the <a href="mailto:users@subversion.apache.org"
       >users@subversion.apache.org</a> mailing list so that other
       community members can provide some first-level help and triage.
       Often times there may already be a solution or answer to your
       problem.</p>
</li>

<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Help us triage existing bug reports</p>
    <p>Subversion gets a pretty steady stream of bug reports.  While
       we do our best to validate each report as comes in, we can't
       possibly prevent every instance of duplicated bug reports, bugs
       that have been fixed without anybody noticing, and so on in our
       <a href="/reporting-issues.html">issue tracker</a>.  One way you
       can help us is by cruising through some of
       our <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SVN%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%3D%22---%22"
       >issues in need of triage</a>, reading the bug reports, and
       attempting to verify that the bug still exists in Subversion.
       If you discover some additional information along the way that
       you think will be useful to the developers, annotate the issue
       and share what you've learned.</p>
</li>

<li id="issues-recipe"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Write a reproduction script</p>
    <p>A well-written bug report is invaluable to developers.  A
       reproduction recipe script, however, is worth a hundred
       well-written reports.  Nothing helps developers understand what
       you were doing when something went wrong better than being able
       to do exactly that something themselves and see the same
       results.  Unfortunately, many bug reports come in via the
       mailing list or issue tracker and offer only prose descriptions
       of the problem.  So another excellent opportunity for
       contribution is to turn those prose reports into reliable,
       repeatable reproduction scripts, perhaps starting with
       a script template
       (<a href="docs/community-guide/repro-template.sh">unix template</a>,
       <a href="docs/community-guide/repro-template.bat">windows template</a>)
       and customizing it to match the report.  This
       provides several benefits to the developers: you save the
       developer(s) the work of creating this script themselves;
       often, your script can be  ported directly to Subversion's
       regression test suite so that the bug, once fixed, stays fixed;
       and having an additional set of eyes on the bug report can
       reveal unforeseen nuances such as the fact that the bug is
       specific to a particular dataset or only happens under some
       other specific circumstances.</p>
</li>

<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Add a node to our build farm</p>

    <p>Subversion has a large regression test suite that takes a
       non-trivial amount of time to run.  Even though developers are
       encouraged to run these tests before committing changes,
       sometimes things fall through the cracks &mdash; "obvious"
       changes turn out not to be, platform-specific bugs crop up,
       etc.  To help us catch these sorts of things, we employ a
       <a href="/buildbot/all">buildbot farm</a>
       of machines continuously testing our codebase as it changes.
       So even if you can't personally take the time to actively test
       Subversion, if you have a computer with cycles to spare, please
       consider adding it as a node in our buildbot farm.  We can
       always benefit from having our test suite executed continuously
       on additional operating systems and machine architectures.</p>
    <p class="todo">Point to buildbot node configuration details here.</p>

</h2>

<ul>
<li id="code-patches"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Submit a patch</p>
    <p>The open-source adage "Patches welcome" may show up most
       frequently as a thread-killing retort to mailing list trolls,
       but at the heart of the statement are two quite genuine ideals:
       software code doesn't write itself, and projects generally
       really do want as many people as possible to help write that
       code.  The Subversion project is no different.  We've accepted
       and applied <a href="http://www.red-bean.com/svnproject/contribulyzer/"
       >countless patch contributions</a>, and we hope to always have
       a constant stream of them.  If you're a developer able to
       contribute in this way, take a cruise through our
       <a href="docs/community-guide/">Subversion Community Guide</a>,
       specifically the sections regarding
       <a href="docs/community-guide/general.html#patches" >patch
       submissions</a> and
       <a href="docs/community-guide/conventions.html" >coding
       conventions</a>, and come join the fun!
       We have a list of <a href="ideas.html">project ideas</a> for those
       who are looking for a sizable project which can take several weeks
       or even several months to complete.</p>
</li>

<li id="code-design"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Help design new features</p>
    <p>Larger features do not just get written when someone has the time
       and inclination to do so&mdash;they get designed first.  The process
       involves discussions on the <a href="mailing-lists#dev-ml">dev@
       list</a>, with reasonably detailed rationales and implementation plans
       fly across the room.  (We often <a
       href="http://wiki.apache.org/subversion/DesignNotes">use our wiki</a>
       to work on the proposed designs.)  Participating in such a discussion
       is an excellent way for users to ensure that planned new features are
       designed from the very beginning to meet their use-cases and wishes, 
       while for larger features holding such a discussion is key to establishing
       <a href="http://producingoss.com/en/social-infrastructure.html"
         >consensus</a> before any coding takes place.</p>
</li>

<li id="code-tests"><p style="font-weight: bold;">Convert a reproduction
    script into a regression test</p>
    <p>Often, users or developers post a <a href="#issues-recipe"
       >reproduction script</a> when
       discussing a bug.  One of the tasks involved in fixing the bug is
       to convert the script (typically a shell script or a batch script)
       into a Python test in <a
       href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/subversion/tests/"
       >Subversion's test suite</a>.  <a href="#code-patches">Sending a
       patch</a> that implements an
       XFail ("eXpected to fail" until the bug has been fixed) test
       equivalent to the reproduction script is a very useful
       contribution, that both serves as a demonstration of the concrete
       fix sought and allows other contributors and developers to spend
       more time researching the cause of the bug and fixes thereto.</p>
</li>


<li><p style="font-weight: bold;">Become a committer and commit code directly</p>
    <p>Developers with a long history of submitting high-quality
       patches can gain direct commit rights.  This is obviously
       beneficial to the developer community &mdash; where quality
       developers are concerned, "the more, the merrier"!  But never
       underestimate how valuable this experience can be to you
       personally
       and <a href="http://onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/07/14/osdevelopers.html"
       >professionally</a>,
       <a href="http://onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/08/01/opensourcedevelopers.html"
