<h1>Apache Subversion Features</h1>

<p>Apache Subversion is a full-featured version control system originally
   designed to be a better 
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System"
   >CVS</a>.  Subversion has since expanded beyond its original goal
   of replacing CVS, but its basic model, design, and interface remain
   heavily influenced by that goal.  Even today, Subversion should
   still feel very familiar to CVS users.</p>

<p>The following list of features is presented with the assumption
   that you, the reader, have a basic understanding of what version
   control is and how version control systems work in general.  If
   there's a feature that you're looking for that is <em>not</em>
   represented in this list, feel free to ask about it on
   our <a href="mailing-lists.html">project mailing lists</a> &mdash;
   perhaps we just didn't think to list it here.  If Subversion truly
   lacks a feature you need, your feedback will help us to improve
   Subversion, and in the meantime, perhaps we can help you meet your
   need with the features that Subversion does have.</p>

<ul>

<li id="cvs-features">
    <strong>Most CVS features.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#cvs-features"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>CVS is a relatively basic version control system.  For the most
    part, Subversion has matched or exceeded CVS's feature set where
    those features continue to apply in Subversion's particular
    design.</p>
</li>

<li id="directory-versioning">
    <strong>Directories are versioned.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#directory-versioning"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Subversion versions directories as first-class objects, just
    like files.</p>
</li>

<li id="action-versioning">
    <strong>Copying, deleting, and renaming are versioned.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#action-versioning"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Copying and deleting are versioned operations.  Renaming is
    also a versioned operation, albeit with some <a
    href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-898"
    >quirks</a>.</p> 
</li>

<li id="properties">
    <strong>Free-form versioned metadata ("properties").
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#properties"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Subversion allows arbitrary metadata ("properties") to be
    attached to any file or directory.  These properties are key/value
    pairs, and are versioned just like the objects they are attached
    to.  Subversion also provides a way to attach arbitrary key/value
    properties to a revision (that is, to a committed changeset).
    These properties are not versioned, since they attach metadata to
    the version-space itself, but they can be changed at any time.</p>
</li>

<li id="atomic-commits">
    <strong>Atomic commits.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#atomic-commits"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>No part of a commit takes
    effect until the entire commit has succeeded.  Revision numbers
    are per-commit, not per-file, and commit's log message is attached
    to its revision, not stored redundantly in all the files affected
    by that commit.</p> </li>

<li id="cheap-copies">
    <strong>Branching and tagging are cheap
            (constant time) operations.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#cheap-copies"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>There is no reason for these operations to be expensive, so
    they aren't.</p>

    <p>Branches and tags are both implemented in terms of an
    underlying "copy" operation.  A copy takes up a small, constant
    amount of space.  Any copy is a tag; and if you start committing
    on a copy, then it's a branch as well.  (This does away with CVS's
    "branch-point tagging", by removing the distinction that made
    branch-point tags necessary in the first place.)</p>
</li>

<li id="merge-tracking">
    <strong>Merge tracking.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#merge-tracking"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Subversion 1.5 introduces merge tracking: automated assistance
    with managing the flow of changes between lines of development,
    and with the merging of branches back into their sources.  The 1.5
    release of merge tracking has basic support for common scenarios;
    we will be extending the feature in upcoming releases.</p>
</li>

<li id="file-locking">
    <strong>File locking.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#file-locking"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Subversion supports (but does not require) locking files so that
    users can be warned when multiple people try to edit the same
    file.  A file can be marked as requiring a lock before being
    edited, in which case Subversion will present the file in
    read-only mode until a lock is acquired.</p>
</li>

<li id="symbolic-links">
    <strong>Symbolic links can be versioned.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#symbolic-links"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Unix users can place symbolic links under version control.  The
    links are recreated in Unix working copies, but not in win32
    working copies.</p>
</li>

<li id="execute-flag">
    <strong>Executable flag is preserved.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#execute-flag"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Subversion notices when a file is executable, and if that file is
    placed into version control, its executability will be preserved
    when it it checked out to other locations.  (The mechanism
    Subversion uses to remember this is simply <a href="#properties"
    >versioned properties</a>, so executability can be manually
    edited when necessary, even from a client that does not
    acknowledge the file's executability, e.g., when having the wrong
    extension under Microsoft Windows).</p>
</li>

<li id="apache-httpd-server">
    <strong>Apache network server option, with WebDAV/DeltaV
            protocol.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#apache-httpd-server"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Subversion can use the HTTP-based
    WebDAV/DeltaV protocol for network communications, and the Apache
    web server to provide repository-side network service.  This gives
    Subversion an advantage over CVS in interoperability, and allows
    certain features (such as authentication, wire compression) to be
    provided in a way that is already familiar to administrators</p>
</li>

<li id="svnserve">
    <strong>Standalone server option (<tt>svnserve</tt>).
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#svnserve"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Subversion offers a standalone server option using a custom
    protocol, since not everyone wants to run an Apache HTTPD server.
    The standalone server can run as an inetd service or in daemon
    mode, and offers the same level of authentication and
    authorization functionality as the HTTPD-based server.  The
    standalone server can also be tunnelled over ssh.</p> </li>

<li id="parseable-output">
    <strong>Parseable output.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#parseable-output"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>All output of the Subversion command-line client is carefully
    designed to be both human readable and automatically parseable;
    scriptability is a high priority.</p>
</li>

<li id="localization">
    <strong>Localized messages.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#localization"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Subversion uses gettext() to display translated error,
    informational, and help messages, based on current locale
    settings.</p>
</li>

<li id="interactive-conflict-resolution">
    <strong>Interactive conflict resolution.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#interactive-conflict-resolution"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>The Subversion command-line client (<tt>svn</tt>) offers
    various ways to resolve conflicting changes, include interactive
    resolution prompting.  This mechanism is also made available via
    APIs, so that other clients (such as graphical clients) can offer
    interactive conflict resolution appropriate to their interfaces.</p>
</li>

<li id="read-only-mirroring">
    <strong>Repository read-only mirroring.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#read-only-mirroring"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Subversion supplies a utility, <tt>svnsync</tt> for synchronizing
    (via either push or pull) a read-only slave repository with a
    master repository.</p>
</li>

<li id="write-through-proxy">
    <strong>Write-through proxy over WebDAV.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#write-through-proxy"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Subversion 1.5 introduces a write-through proxy feature that
    allows slave repositories (see <a href="#read-only-mirroring"
    >read-only mirroring</a>) to handle all read operations
    themselves while passing write operations through to the master.
    This feature is only available with the Apache HTTPD (WebDAV)
    server option.</p>

</li>

<li id="modular-design">
    <strong>Natively client/server, layered library design with
            clean APIs.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#modular-design"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p> Subversion is designed to be client/server from the beginning;
    thus avoiding some of the maintenance problems which have plagued
    CVS.  The code is structured as a set of modules with well-defined
    interfaces, designed to be called by other applications.</p>
</li>

<li id="binary-files">
    <strong>Binary files handled efficiently.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#binary-files"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Subversion is equally efficient on binary as on text files,
    because it uses a binary diffing algorithm to transmit and store
    successive revisions.</p>
</li>

<li id="proportionality">
    <strong>Costs are proportional to change size, not data size.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#proportionality"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>In general, the time required for a Subversion operation is
    proportional to the size of the <em>changes</em> resulting from that
    operation, not to the absolute size of the project in which the
    changes are taking place.</p>
</li>

<li id="bindings">
    <strong>Bindings to programming languages.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#bindings"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>The Subversion APIs come with bindings for many programming
    languages, such as Python, Perl, Java, and Ruby.  (Subversion
    itself is written in C.)</p>
</li>

<li id="changelists">
    <strong>Changelists.
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#changelists"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>Subversion 1.5 introduces changelists, which allows a user to
    put modified files into named groups on the client side, and then
    commit by specifying a particular group.  For those who work on
    logically separate changesets simultaneously in the same directory
    tree, changelists can help keep things organized.</p>
</li>

<li id="more">
    <strong>And more...
      <a class="sectionlink" href="#more"
        title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
    </strong>
    <p>...even when we manage to keep this list up-to-date, it isn't
    possible to list every little feature.  See the <a
    href="docs/" >documentation</a> for more information.</p>
