<h1>Apache Subversion Roadmap</h1>

<div class="h2" id="upcoming-releases">
<h2>Upcoming Releases
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#upcoming-releases"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>The following is a <em>preliminary</em> timetable for the next few
   upcoming releases.  Dates, feature deliverables, and even version
   numbers found in this list are all subject to change (and become
   increasingly more speculative the further out we attempt to
   project).  Fortunately, the same dynamics that allow features to
   fall out of releases or for release dates to slip also allow for
   feature and release acceleration.  That's the nature of
   open-source, community-driven software projects (and we think it's
   a great thing).  So if you don't like what you see here, do
   something about it: your
   <a href="/contributing.html">contributions</a> are always welcome!</p>

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="centered">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>Task</th>
    <th>Deliverables / Notes</th>

    <td>2017? <em>(tentative)</em></td>
    <td>Release 1.10.0</td>
    <td>...
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>We try to roll releases on Wednesdays.  Like most of the other
   information on this page, the day we roll isn't a hard-and-fast
   rule, but it is something that has been useful in the past.
   Rolling mid-week gives us enough time for the release preparation
   process in the couple of days prior to the release, and some time
   before the weekend for validation of the release tarballs.  The
   release is finalized and announced as soon after the completion of
   the validation process as possible.  See the documentation of our
   <a href="/docs/community-guide/releasing.html" >release process</a>
   for more information.</p>

<div class="h2" id="release-planning">
<h2>How We Plan Releases
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#release-planning"
    title="Link to this section">&para;</a>
</h2>

<p>Subversion uses a compromise between time-driven and feature-driven
release planning.  We schedule the next release for an approximate
date (very approximate), and make sure it contains one or more new
features or other significant differentiators, but we don't say
exactly what those new features will be.  This is because we're always
working on several things at once, and we want to give each new
feature time to mature.  Especially given the decentralized nature of
open-source development, we're wary of forcing technical discussions
to premature consensus.  At the same time, it's good for the project
to have regular releases, so we try to keep to a schedule and to
have <em>something</em> ready to roll out when the release date comes
along.</p>

<p>In this context, "release" means an increment of the minor release
number, which is the middle number in our three-component system.
Thus, 1.2.0, 1.3.0, and 1.4.0 are successive minor releases in the
"1.x" line, whereas 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and 1.1.3 are successive patch
(bugfix) releases in the "1.1.x" line.  We don't schedule patch
releases far in advance, we just put them out when we feel enough
bugfixes have accumulated to warrant it.  Major new releases, such as
Subversion 2.0, will probably be done much like the minor releases,
just with more planning around the exact features.  For more
information about Subversion's release numbering and compatibility
policies, see the section entitled
<a href="/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-numbering" >"Release
numbering, compatibility, and deprecation"</a> in the
<a href="/docs/community-guide/">Subversion Community Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Our "Most Wanted" Features
  <a class="sectionlink" href="#features-most-wanted"

</h2>

<p>The following is a list of "most wanted" features/enhancements
   we've identified as important and achievable, in no particular
   order, along with the chain of dependendies we believe exist and
   stand in the way of our delivering these items in
   Subversion.  <em>This is not an exhaustive list!</em>  It merely
   represents some of the "the big ones" &mdash; big in impact, and
   probably big in development cost.</p>
