The following are some things have been suggested as improvements to
the subversion.apache.org website.

  * Replace the 'class="todo"' items on the site with the content
    indicated.

  * Pointing folks to the most popular third-party Subversion clients
    and plugins and stuff.  (Note: this is expressly *not* meant to be
    an exhaustive list of Subversion-related links.  We're done with
    maintaining that list.)

  * Pointing folks to the various language bindings.  (Perhaps this can
    be done on the 'Binary Packages' page, helping folks get their
    bindings on a platform-by-platform basis.)

  * Get a nightly build of trunk C-API and JavaHL docs going.  Point
    folks to it (and other useful things) via the currently-obscured
    /dev/index.html page.

  * Figure out how to integrate the Apache auto-mirror-selection stuff
    once we have downloads available from apache.org.

  * Throw Google Ads all over the pages to line C-Mike's pockets.
    (Just kidding.)
